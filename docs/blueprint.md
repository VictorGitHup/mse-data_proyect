- Accent color: Soft lavender (#B39DDB), to highlight interactive elements and calls to action without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font with a modern look suitable for both headlines and body text, for a clean and readable interface.
- Simple, minimalist icons for navigation and common actions, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding.
- Clean and organized layout, emphasizing readability and ease of navigation. Use of whitespace to create a sense of clarity and order.
